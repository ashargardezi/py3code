# Question: Write a Python program that uses a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers and prints each number multiplied by 2. The list contains the following numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
# x=[1,2,3,4,5,7,9]
# for i in x:
#     print(i)
#     product=i*2
#     print(product)
    # Question: Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers. Implement a while loop that continues to prompt for numbers until the user enters a negative number. Inside the loop, calculate the square of each positive number entered and print it. Finally, display the sum of all the squared numbers entered.
# sum=0
# x=int(input("please enter the numbers"))
# while x>=0:
#    y=x*2
#    print(y)
#    sum +=y
#    x=int(input("please enter the - number for exit"))
  
# print(sum)
x=0
y=12
while x<y:
    # print(x)
    x=x +1
    if x==10:
        continue
    print("5 x ",x,"=",x*5)
